# REQUIREMENTS
#### _INTRODUCTION_
 * The mini porject which I am going to implement is a scientific calculator. 
 * A scientific calculator is used to do scientific calculations. 
 * I am implementing complex and vector functions in my mini project
 * This priject is very helpful for students and working professionals who want a calculator to perform calculations.
#### _RESEARCH_
 * Scientific calculator
   1. Calculate basic functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.<br>
   2. Also has modulus and factorial calculations.<br>
   3. It has two modes - Complex and vector mode. <br>
      1. Complex mode is used for calculations involving complex numbers.
      2. Vector mode is used to operate with vectors.
# SWOT ANALYSIS
